        	<h3><i>Washboard Abs</i></h3>

        <p align="justify">The desire to have a flat abdomen is not specific to gender. Men and women alike want washboard abs. Many people exercise routinely, eat healthy, avoid sugars and carbohydrates yet they cannot get rid of that pocket of fat on their stomach. We routinely call these areas love-handles or muffin top and complain about the lines we can see in our stomach not from muscle definition but from the fat that bulges over when you’ve been sitting down for an extended period of time. Dr. Agha has found CoolSculpting to be extremely effective in eliminating unwanted belly fat. There are two types of stomach fat Dr. Agha focuses on when evaluating whether a patient is a candidate for treatment on their abdomen. Abdominal fat shows itself in two forms: the subcutaneous fat which is often squishy and rolly and sits on the top of your rib cage and waist which you can actually grab a hold of with your hand. The other type is visceral fat which is found around your organs and can cause your stomach to look rounded or give you the appearance of a pot belly. CoolSculpting can treat both types of these problems and Dr. Agha will evaluate your problem area and discuss with you in detail what your desired results will be. One thing to note when using CoolSculpting to treat abdominal fat is that a number of patients have expressed mild discomfort for one or two days post-treatment as opposed to those who have had other areas treated and did not express any discomfort or pain.</p>

        	<h3><i>Tight Legs and Thighs</i></h3>

        <p align="justify">Fat on your inner and outer thighs are two areas that cause a lot of women to feel uncomfortable in swimsuits, the dreaded skinny jean and have probably helped shapewear sky rocket in sales! Dr. Agha believes CoolSculpting has made a significant advance in the reduction of localized areas of fat. Each procedure’s success is dependent on a number of factors. The most important factor is the location of the areas of fat. Dr. Agha evaluates each patient and whether they have approximately 2 inches of tissue that you can physically grab on to. This is crucial as there needs to be enough tissue for the applicator to hold on to. Specifically, when treating the inner thigh Dr. Agha examines you to ensure that the treatment of fat on your inner thigh will result in not only the removal of that fat but not accentuate the removal with the replacement of loose and saggy skin. If you are suffering from loose skin on your inner and outer thighs then Dr. Agha and his expertise in body surgery will be more than pleased to discuss alternate options for the removal of that skin. Conversely, if you are unhappy with the commonly referenced saddlebag area or thunder thighs, then CoolSculpting could be just what you are looking for. This treatment can help restore your confidence and re-proportion your thigh area with your waist and lower legs so you are left with a more proportionate and aesthetically pleasing lower body silhouette. The best part is that it can all be done in about an hour!</p>

        	<h3>Some Motivating Message - Male Chest</h3>

        <p align="justify">If you are considering CoolSculpting for your chest, there are two things Dr. Agha identifies with a male patient. First, some males suffer from gynecomastia which is identified as the proliferation of the male breast tissue. CoolSculpting is most likely not a treatment designed for this condition. If you are experiencing subcutaneous, excess pockets of fat on your chest then CoolSculpting would be able to target this area and work to eliminate that fat from your chest. In general, males find the issue of fat on their chest to be a sensitive and embarrassing one. Perhaps you have tried extreme dieting, rigorous weight lifting regimens and even tried to wear clothing that is more loose-fitting to hide the appearance of fat on your chest. Dr. Agha is committed to educating his patients in all aspects of areas related to the enhancement of their bodies. If you are a suffering from gynecomastia or just stubborn pockets of fat on your chest, Dr. Agha will give you his expert opinion and help you find a solution so you can look in the mirror and see the results you desire, but more importantly restore your self-confidence.</p>

    <div id="coolsculpting-back" class="collapse desc col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
        	<h3>Some Motivating Message - Back</h3>

        <p align="justify">Dr. Agha has heard many patients complain about wanting to rid themselves of back fat. However, back fat encompasses many areas and these can be different for both men and women. Often, these are referred to as back fat, bra fat, love handles and flanks. CoolSculpting is a highly effective non-surgical option to reduce unwanted fat in these areas. The beauty of CoolSculpting is the ability to zero-in on the specific area that you are displeased with thus the ability for Dr. Agha to individualize your treatment plan. Whether that is the skin underneath your bra strap or sitting above the back of your pants, Dr. Agha will be able to guide you through your consultation and explain in detail the reduction in fat you will see after your treatment. If it is necessary for you to undergo multiple treatments to rid yourself of unwanted back fat he would recommend scheduling these treatments approximately 8 weeks apart.</p>

        	<h3>Some Motivating Message - Arms</h3>

        <p align="justify">Dr. Agha’s approach to treating the upper arm area with CoolSculpting is unique in that he reminds his patients that CoolSculpting is a procedure designed to reduce fat and not shrink excessively lax skin. You may be an ideal candidate if you feel that your arms look large in everything you wear (sleeves or no sleeves). Do you feel no matter how much you exercise you cannot rid yourself of that stubborn bulge on your arms? Dr. Agha has an expert eye related to body, fat, skin and proportions. He does not believe this is a procedure designed to treat areas where there is severe looseness in your skin. For example, if you are bothered by batwings or loose hanging skin on your arms, you may be a candidate for brachiaplasty more commonly known as an arm lift. These are all factors that will be addressed in your personalized consultation with Dr. Agha.</p>
